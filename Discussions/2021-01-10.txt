Points to be discussed :-
-Release date -> routing issue
	ES : uses hashing for sharding
		based on movie id
			Maintain a sorted list of movie ids vs release date (sorting on date) in a separate table
				Adding an entry : O(logn)
				Read : O(1)
				How to have a clustered index on ES? Solution : use RDBMS or a NoSQL which
			Sort while starting service : 10^14/10^9 = 10^5 s > few hours

-Column name in CamelCase

-Comments to be added in lifo manner

-In movie table store actor name instead of id
	we store both
-Images of actors to be stored in a file system (folder name = actor id, predeteremined pic name) instead of storing path in actor table.
	Use actor id in movide table to extract the image frm the predefinedd folder.
-Insert movie id and movie name list in Actor table
